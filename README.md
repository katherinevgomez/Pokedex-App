# Pokedex-App

This app was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app displays a library containing 151 pokemons; the stats displayed
on the card shows its name,type, id, weight and height. 
The website logo refreshes the page when clicked. The cards display different colors depending on which type of pokemon they are.
A search bar above the pokemons serves as a placeholder until I add the correct functionality to successfully search data within the API.
